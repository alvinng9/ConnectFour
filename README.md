# ConnectFour

Authors: Alvin Nguyen and John Nguyen

This program allows the user to play a game of Connect Four against another player.

Connect Four is a board game where two players take turns dropping a piece down a column of a board. The player who completes a chain of four pieces in any direction (up/down, left/right, diagonal) wins. If the board fills up without any player completing a chain of four pieces, the game ends in a tie.

In our version of the game, the user can select several options to customize their game, including:<br/>
-size of the board<br/>
-number of pieces required to win<br/>
-color of each player's pieces<br/>
-player names<br/>

While playing, the name and color of the player who is next to move will be displayed at the bottom of the window. The current game can be saved and loaded, as well as reset, at any time during the game. The players can also view statistics on how many times each player has won, and the number of ties that have occured.
